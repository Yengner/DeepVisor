# DeepVisor 🚀

<div align="center">
  <h3>Digital Advertising Platform Project</h3>
  <p><i>A work-in-progress learning project with startup aspirations</i></p>
</div>

## Project Overview

DeepVisor is an in-development platform that aims to simplify digital advertising management across multiple platforms. As a college project focused on learning modern web development and API integration, it serves both as a practical education in software engineering and a potential startup concept.

**Current Status**: Early development with Meta API integration in progress.

### Vision

The vision for DeepVisor is to create a unified dashboard where users can:
- Create and manage ad campaigns across multiple platforms
- View normalized performance metrics in one place
- Leverage AI for campaign optimization and budget allocation
- Generate client-friendly reports and analytics

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15+ with Mantine UI
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes with Node.js
- **Database & Auth**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Authentication)
- **API Integrations**: Meta Marketing API (in progress)

## Current Implementation

### Meta Integration (In Progress)

The current focus is on implementing Meta (Facebook & Instagram) ad campaign creation:

- ✅ OAuth authentication with Meta Business accounts
- ✅ Campaign builder UI with form validation
- 🔄 Campaign creation API integration
- 🔄 Strategy Pattern for flexible campaign parameters
- ⬜ Reporting and analytics

### Code Architecture

We're implementing the Strategy Pattern for flexible campaign parameter building:

```typescript
// Example of Strategy Pattern implementation
export async function createCreative(params: MetaCreativeParams): Promise<string> {
  // Get the appropriate strategy based on campaign objective
  const strategy = getCreativeStrategy(formData.objective);
  
  // Apply the strategy to get objective-specific parameters
  const creativeParams = strategy.buildCreativeParams(
    baseParams, 
    formData, 
    pageId,
    isSmartCampaign,
    creativeVariation
  );
  
  // API call with the parameters
  // ...
}
```

## Future Development Plans

While currently focused on Meta integration, the project has ambitious plans for expansion:

    A[Campaign Creation UI] --> B[Platform Adapter Factory]
    B --> C[Meta Adapter]
    B --> D[TikTok Adapter]
    B --> E[Google Ads Adapter]
    B --> F[LinkedIn Adapter]
    
    C --> H[Meta Campaign Strategy]
    D --> I[TikTok Campaign Strategy]
    E --> J[Google Campaign Strategy]
    F --> K[LinkedIn Campaign Strategy]
```

### Smart Campaigns Feature Plan

Future versions aim to implement AI-powered campaign optimization:

```mermaid

    A[Smart Campaigns] --> B[Audience Discovery]
    A --> C[Creative Testing]
    A --> D[Budget Optimization]
    
    B --> B1[Lookalike Generation]
    B --> B2[Interest Analysis]
    
    C --> C1[Multi-Variate Testing]
    C --> C2[Creative Elements Analysis]
    
    D --> D1[Budget Shifting]
    D --> D2[ROAS Optimization]
```

### Analytics Vision

The planned analytics system will unify data from multiple platforms:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Platform APIs] --> B[Data Ingestion Layer]
    B --> C[Data Normalization]
    C --> D[Unified Data Schema]
    D --> E[Combined Analytics]
    E --> F[Unified Dashboard]
    E --> G[Cross-Platform Insights]
```
