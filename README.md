# **DeepVisor** 🚀
### **All-in-One Advertising Platform & Agency Companion**

DeepVisor is a SaaS solution that helps **individuals and businesses** manage advertising across multiple networks, including **Meta (Facebook & Instagram), TikTok, Google Ads, Reddit, YouTube, and more**. The platform is built to work alongside our advertising agency, giving clients transparent access to campaign results while also generating leads for the agency itself.

Users can **integrate, track, analyze, and optimize ad campaigns** from one dashboard. DeepVisor offers automation tools, AI-driven suggestions, and unique marketing utilities like scannable barcodes that link to a business hub and the option to add a digital business card to **Apple Wallet**.

With the recent addition of the `/public/proposal/[token]` page, clients will receive proposal links via email. Visiting this link opens a public proposal page where they can approve the proposal or request revisions (functionality in progress).

This README outlines the current workflow, database structure, and features planned for future development.

## Multi-Platform Campaign Creation

### Architecture

```mermaid

    A[Campaign Creation UI] --> B[Platform Adapter Factory]
    B --> C[Meta Adapter]
    B --> D[TikTok Adapter]
    B --> E[Google Ads Adapter]
    B --> F[LinkedIn Adapter]
    B --> G[Future Platforms...]
    
    C --> H[Meta Campaign Strategy]

    F --> K[LinkedIn Campaign Strategy]
    
    H --> L[Campaign Creation]
    I --> L
    J --> L
    K --> L
```

### Implementation Plan

The multi-platform campaign creation will follow these principles:

1. **Platform Adapter Pattern**
   - Create standardized interfaces for each platform
   - Platform-specific adapters handle API differences
   - Common campaign models translated to platform-specific parameters

2. **Unified Campaign Flow**
   ```typescript
   // Example Multi-Platform Campaign Creation
   export async function createMultiPlatformCampaign(formData: MultiPlatformCampaignValues): Promise<MultiCampaignResult> {
     const platforms = formData.selectedPlatforms; // e.g., ['meta', 'tiktok']
     const results = {};
     
     for (const platform of platforms) {
       const adapter = getPlatformAdapter(platform);
       const platformFormData = adapter.transformFormData(formData);
       results[platform] = await adapter.createCampaign(platformFormData);
     }
     
     // Create unified campaign record in database
     const unifiedCampaign = await createUnifiedCampaignRecord(results, formData);
     
     return {
       unifiedCampaignId: unifiedCampaign.id,
       platformResults: results
     };
   }
   ```

3. **Similar Campaign Types Across Platforms**
   - Map objectives between platforms (e.g., Meta's "LEAD_GENERATION" to TikTok's "LEAD_GENERATION")
   - Translate targeting parameters to each platform's requirements
   - Adapt creative assets to platform-specific formats and requirements

4. **Synchronized Campaign Management**
   - Status synchronization (pause/activate across platforms)
   - Budget adjustments proportionally across platforms
   - Performance data consolidation

## Unified Analytics and Reporting

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Platform APIs] --> B[Data Ingestion Layer]
    B --> C[Data Normalization]
    C --> D[Unified Data Schema]
    D --> E[Combined Analytics]
    E --> F[Unified Dashboard]
    E --> G[Cross-Platform Insights]
    
    H[Meta Data] --> A
    I[TikTok Data] --> A
    J[Google Data] --> A
    K[LinkedIn Data] --> A
```

### Features

1. **Combined Campaign Performance View**
   - Aggregated metrics across platforms (impressions, clicks, conversions)
   - Side-by-side platform comparison
   - Attribution modeling across platforms

2. **Unified Cost Analysis**
   - Total campaign spend across platforms
   - Cost per result metrics normalized across platforms
   - Budget utilization and efficiency insights

3. **Cross-Platform Audience Insights**
   - Audience overlap analysis
   - Platform-specific audience performance
   - Demographic performance comparison

4. **Custom Report Builder**
   - User-configurable reports spanning multiple platforms
   - Scheduled report delivery
   - Export capabilities in multiple formats

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Client Application] --> B[API Gateway]
    
    B --> C[Campaign Service]
    B --> D[Analytics Service]
    B --> E[User Management]

    D --> K[Data Lake]
    G --> K
    
    K --> L[Analytics Engine]
    L --> D
    
    G --> M[ML Pipeline]
    M --> G
```

### Implementation Challenges and Solutions

1. **API Inconsistency Between Platforms**
   - **Challenge**: Each advertising platform has different API structures, parameters, and limitations
   - **Solution**: Adapter pattern with platform-specific implementations behind common interfaces

2. **Data Normalization**
   - **Challenge**: Metrics and dimensions vary across platforms
   - **Solution**: Standardized data schema with platform-specific transformers

3. **Authentication and Permission Management**
   - **Challenge**: Different OAuth flows and permission models
   - **Solution**: Unified authentication service with platform-specific handlers

4. **Rate Limiting and API Quotas**
   - **Challenge**: Each platform has different rate limits and quotas
   - **Solution**: Queue-based architecture with backoff strategies and quota monitoring

5. **Keeping Up With Platform Changes**
   - **Challenge**: Ad platforms frequently update their APIs
   - **Solution**: Versioned adapters and automated tests for platform compatibility

## Development Approach

1. **Phased Implementation**
   - Start with core platform extensions (Meta + TikTok)
   - Add Google Ads integration in second phase
   - Expand to other platforms based on user demand

2. **Modular Architecture**
   - Core services independent of specific platforms
   - Platform-specific modules that can be developed and deployed independently
   - Clear interfaces between systems

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Comprehensive unit tests for platform adapters
   - Integration tests with platform sandbox environments
   - End-to-end testing of multi-platform campaigns

4. **Continuous Deployment**
   - Feature flags for gradual rollout
   - A/B testing for new optimization strategies
   - Monitoring and alerting for platform-specific issues
